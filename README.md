# CUDA-Monte-Carlo-Integration
This repository demonstrates how to perform Monte Carlo integration using CUDA on a GPU. It includes a Python implementation with Numba, showcasing efficient high-dimensional integration of arbitrary functions. The example provided integrates a Gaussian function and visualizes the sampled points and computed integral values.
